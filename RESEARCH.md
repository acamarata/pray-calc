Dynamically Determining Twilight Angles for Fajr and Isha

Introduction

Accurate calculation of Fajr (dawn) and Isha (nightfall) prayer times hinges on the Sun’s depression angle under the horizon at the onset or end of twilight. Traditional prayer timetables often assume a static twilight angle (e.g. 18°, 17°, 15°) for these prayers. However, a one-size-fits-all angle is not universally valid – the true observable onset of dawn or end of dusk varies with geography and season ￼. This report explores the most accurate methods to dynamically determine the twilight angle based on latitude, longitude, and date, instead of relying on fixed approximations. We review theoretical models of twilight, empirical observation data, and an established global algorithm to adjust the Fajr/Isha angle throughout the year. Implementation considerations (including elevation and atmospheric parameters) for integration into prayer time calculators and academic references are also discussed.

Background: Twilight and Prayer Time Calculations

In astronomical terms, twilight is the period of partial illumination before sunrise and after sunset, caused by scattering of sunlight in the upper atmosphere when the Sun is below the horizon. Twilight is commonly defined in three stages by fixed Sun depression angles ￼:
	•	Civil Twilight – Sun ~6° below horizon (enough light for civil activity).
	•	Nautical Twilight – Sun ~12° below horizon (horizon still discernible at sea).
	•	Astronomical Twilight – Sun ~18° below horizon (sky almost completely dark).

For Islamic prayer times: Fajr begins at true dawn (when a faint horizontal light – “white thread” – is first visible in the sky), and Isha begins at complete nightfall (when lingering twilight disappears). Traditionally, Muslim astronomers in the 19th–20th centuries equated Fajr and Isha with astronomical twilight at 18° depression ￼. In practice, various conventions arose: for example, calendars might use 18°, 17°, 15° or even fixed time intervals (e.g. 90 minutes) after sunset for Isha ￼. These approximations were attempts to match the Shari’ah descriptions: Fajr at the appearance of dawn light, and Isha at the disappearance of evening glow ￼.

Crucially, neither the Qur’an nor Hadith fixes a numeric angle for these signs ￼ – the mandate is to follow the observable phenomena of Subh Sadiq (true dawn) and Shafaq (twilight after sunset). True dawn is defined by a broad, horizontal whitening of the eastern horizon (distinguishing it from the false dawn, a vertical light that can appear earlier), and Shafaq ends with the fading of either the red or white twilight glow in the west ￼ ￼. Any calculation method must therefore be grounded in reproducing these observable cues as closely as possible.

Limitations of Static Angles

Using a single fixed depression angle (be it 18°, 15°, or any value) for all locations and dates leads to errors. Observational campaigns and research have confirmed that no single degree is correct for every latitude ￼. A static-angle method might coincidentally work in some regions (for instance, 18° is often a reasonable match near the equator ￼), but will be inaccurate elsewhere ￼. Key issues include:
	•	High Latitude Anomalies: At higher latitudes in summer, the Sun may not sink far enough below the horizon to reach the assumed angle. For example, above ~48.5°N, the Sun never goes 18° down on summer solstice ￼; above ~51.5°N it never goes 15° down ￼. This means using 18° or 15° simply fails (Fajr would absurdly never start, or Isha never end, on some days) ￼. Even when the Sun does reach the angle on other days, it may do so very late at night. In Cambridge, UK (~52°N), Isha at 15° occurs ~2.5 hours after sunset on ordinary summer nights ￼ – an impractically late time, illustrating “undue hardship” ￼. Clearly, a fixed rule is untenable in such regions.
	•	Low/Mid Latitude Discrepancies: Even in middle latitudes and the tropics, studies have found that true dawn often occurs at a different angle than the commonly assumed 18°. In Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, the official calendars long used ~18.5°–19° for Fajr ￼. But observations in dark-sky deserts show dawn actually breaks at around 14°–15° depression in those conditions ￼ ￼. Similarly, an Indonesian study (spanning 6 observatories near the equator) found Fajr light became visible at about 16.5° sun elevation, whereas the national calendar was using 20° – a difference of ~3.5° that translates to nearly 14 minutes timing error ￼. In other words, a one-value-fits-all angle can make Fajr too early by tens of minutes in some locales, or potentially too late in others.
	•	Seasonal Variation: Fixed-angle methods ignore that the duration and character of twilight change with seasons. Even at a given location, the atmosphere’s illumination at (say) 18° is not constant year-round. Around equinoxes the Sun’s path is steeper, twilight is shorter, and the sky might need a slightly deeper Sun to see dawn; near summer solstice, twilight is prolonged and a shallower depression may suffice for noticeable light. Static schedules cannot capture these subtleties.

As a result of these issues, Muslim communities have faced confusion and widely varying timetables ￼. In recent years, many have adjusted their angles downward in search of better accuracy. For example, Ulama in the UK moved from 18° to 15°, 12°, or even 9° in summer for Fajr/Isha ￼; and the Fiqh Council of North America shifted to 15° for Fajr based on research findings. While such fixed-angle adjustments mitigate gross errors, they remain blunt instruments. The consensus emerging from technical studies is that Fajr and Isha cannot be tied to a single fixed depression angle everywhere and every night ￼ – rather, a dynamic, location-aware approach is needed ￼.

Empirical Observations of Twilight Angles

Extensive observational data collected over the past decade has mapped how the “true dawn” and “true dusk” angles vary with latitude and season. Notably, the Moonsighting Committee Worldwide undertook a systematic campaign, gathering dawn/dusk observations from locations as diverse as Karachi (25°N), Durban (30°S), Sydney (34°S), Miami (26°N), Toronto (43°N), High Wycombe UK (51.6°N), and others ￼. Their findings clearly showed no constant angle gave correct results at all these sites ￼. Instead, the data demonstrated that the requisite Sun depression for Fajr and Isha is a function of latitude and the day of year ￼. In other words, the twilight angle changes predictably as one moves north/south or through the seasons.

Some representative empirical results from various studies are summarized below:
	•	Low Latitudes (~0–30°): True dawn is typically observed when the Sun is around 16–18° below the horizon. For example, measurements in Indonesia (multiple stations around ~6°S to 7°S) found Fajr at –16.5° on average ￼. In very clear, dark-sky conditions near the equator, the angle may approach 18° (astronomical twilight) – Moonsighting’s research suggests 18° is appropriate at the equator ￼ – but generally not beyond that. This refines the long-held 19–20° used in some equatorial regions, which proved overly conservative.
	•	Mid Latitudes (~25–45°): Observations consistently show dawn/dusk occur around 14–16° depression. A comprehensive Egyptian study (multiple sites at ~26–30°N, using cameras, Sky Quality Meters, and naked-eye observers over 2015–2019) reported true dawn at a mean Sun depression of 14.56° (± ~$1σ$) ￼. Their instrumental measurements for light intensity similarly put the threshold in the 14–15° range ￼. An earlier campaign in Hail, Saudi Arabia (27.5°N, desert) recorded Fajr onset between 13.5° and 14.7°, averaging 14.0° ￼. Likewise, desert observations in Libya and other Gulf areas yielded ~14.8° for dawn ￼. These studies, conducted in pristine atmospheres free of light pollution, strongly indicate that 15° (not 18°) is closer to the true twilight angle in typical mid-latitude conditions. (The difference is significant: using 18° would make Fajr about 20–30 minutes earlier than when the dawn light is actually perceptible ￼ ￼.)
	•	High Mid-Latitudes (~45–55°): As one approaches higher latitudes, the required depression angle continues to decrease, especially around summer. For instance, at 50°N the effective Fajr angle might be on the order of 12–15° depending on season (see next section for model-based examples). Empirical community observations in the UK (mid-50s latitude) have often reported that the 18° times are too early; some local bodies set Fajr when the Sun is about 12° down during summer months, based on when a true horizontal dawn glow was actually seen. This aligns with the general trend seen in data: by ~51–52°N, even a 15° depression can coincide with an extremely faint or non-existent twilight in midsummer ￼. Thus observed practice and recommended angles in these regions have adjusted downward for practicality and accuracy.
	•	Very High Latitudes (>55°): Beyond 55–60°, the summer Sun never goes far enough below the horizon to produce full darkness. Traditional angle methods break down completely here. Observations in such extreme cases are difficult (dawn and dusk blend together). Islamic juristic solutions often invoke “Sab‘ul Layl” (dividing night into seventh parts) or nearest latitude approximations rather than any twilight angle ￼ ￼. These areas underscore the need for special-case handling (discussed later), but the general principle is that physical twilight ceases to exist in summer above certain latitudes, so a dynamic model must gracefully transition to alternate rules.

Overall, the collective evidence from these studies is that true dawn (Subh Sadiq) typically appears when the Sun is ~14–16° below the horizon in most populated regions, and only in ideal dark conditions near the tropics does it approach 18°. Angles like 19° or 20° are nearly never observed as the point of first light – those were conservative estimates that made Fajr earlier than necessary by a wide margin ￼. Conversely, at higher latitudes in protracted twilights, even 15° may be too deep – dawn may not break until ~12–13°. Any accurate model must capture this gradation. The next section describes how we can formulate such a model.

Theoretical Basis for Twilight Angle Variation

Why does the required twilight angle vary? Several astronomical and atmospheric factors are at play:
	•	Sun’s Path Inclination: The angle at which the Sun’s path intersects the horizon depends on latitude and the Sun’s declination (season). Near the equator, the Sun rises and sets almost vertically, so it plummets through the atmosphere quickly. In those conditions, by the time it reaches 18° below, the sky has only just become truly dark – hence 18° roughly marks dawn there ￼. At higher latitudes, especially in summer, the Sun’s path is oblique to the horizon. It “skims” below the horizon at a shallow angle, prolonging twilight. This means the sky stays illuminated to some degree even at smaller depression angles. Practically, a location like 50–55°N might still have noticeable twilight at 15° or even 12° depression because the Sun is never far below the horizon for very long. The geometry of Earth’s tilt causes a seasonal effect too: around the summer solstice, the Sun’s declination is near the observer’s latitude (for example, at 54°N, the Sun’s declination at midsummer (~23.5°N) is not far off, so it never dips much below the horizon at midnight) ￼. In winter, the Sun’s path is steeper (dec in opposite hemisphere), so twilight is shorter and a deeper depression is needed to end it.
	•	Atmospheric Scattering and Luminance: Twilight is produced by scattering of sunlight in the upper atmosphere. As the Sun goes further below the horizon, exponentially less sunlight reaches the lower sky. There isn’t a single “on/off” threshold; instead, brightness fades gradually. Defining dawn essentially means picking a threshold brightness at which the sky’s illumination is distinguishable from full night. Astronomers historically picked 18° as the point where the sky is astronomically dark (only ~0.001 lux illumination). But human eyes can’t detect sky illumination at such a faint level if any ambient light is present. Studies that measured sky surface brightness found that the human-visible dawn corresponds to a somewhat brighter threshold. For example, one research group noted a 0.015 cd/m² luminance threshold (mesopic vision limit) correlating with dawn at about 14°–15° depression in their data ￼. In essence, by the time the Sun rises to ~15° below the horizon, the sky glow has intensified enough to be seen as “white thread” dawn by a dark-adapted normal eye ￼. Below that (say at 18°), the sky is still in near-total darkness or the light is too diffuse to perceive as dawn. This explains why 18° is often too early for Fajr: the illumination exists in theory, but it’s below the visual threshold or masked by airglow/light pollution until the Sun comes a bit closer.
	•	“False Dawn” Phenomenon: Another consideration is false dawn (the zodiacal light – sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust along the ecliptic). This faint column of light can sometimes be mistaken for the early stages of dawn. It typically appears well before true dawn and is more prominent in certain seasons (e.g. spring) and low latitudes. Observers have noted that the full, typical shape of false dawn is not present every day and usually vanishes by about 15° sun depression ￼. After that, the true horizontal dawn glow takes over. The presence of zodiacal light on some mornings can make it tricky to identify exactly when “first light” from the atmosphere begins, but careful studies (using color spectrum analysis and multiple criteria) have differentiated it. They find the true dawn light is indeed around the ~14–15° mark, whereas any illumination seen at deeper angles (16–18°) was often due to these other sources or instrumental sensitivity ￼ ￼. This further reinforces choosing a model based on actual dawn glows, not just any detectable light.

In summary, the required twilight angle is dynamic because of Earth’s axial tilt and atmospheric physics. Higher latitudes and longer twilights mean the sky stays brighter for a given solar depression, requiring a smaller angle to define “night”. Shorter twilights near the equator allow the sky to get darker, needing a larger angle to reach the dawn light threshold. Any robust model must account for these dynamics – essentially capturing the relationship between latitude, season, and the twilight phenomenon.

Dynamic Twilight Angle Models

Empirical Latitude-Season Formula (Moonsighting Method)

One of the most cited and validated dynamic models is the empirical formula developed by Moonsighting.com (often referred to as the Moonsighting Committee Worldwide method). This model explicitly computes the Fajr and Isha twilight angle (or equivalently, the time offset from sunset/sunrise) as a function of the latitude and the day of the year ￼. It was derived by curve-fitting to a large set of observed twilight times, with careful consideration of higher-latitude edge cases. The approach can be summarized as follows:
	•	Baseline and Parameters: The model assumes that at the equator (lat = 0°), true dawn/dusk corresponds to 18° depression (historically used and supported by observations at low latitudes) ￼. From this baseline, it introduces latitude-dependent adjustments. Four seasonal reference points are defined for each latitude: values corresponding to the winter solstice, spring equinox, summer solstice, and autumn equinox. These were denoted as constants A, B, C, D (in minutes of time offset) in the committee’s documentation ￼. For Fajr, for example, at latitude φ:
	•	A = 75 + (28.65/55)*|φ|  (minutes) – offset at winter solstice (day with shortest sunlight) ￼.
	•	B = 75 + (19.44/55)*|φ|  – offset at spring equinox.
	•	C = 75 + (32.74/55)*|φ|  – offset at late spring (around May 15).
	•	D = 75 + (48.10/55)*|φ|  – offset at summer solstice (longest day) ￼.
(Here 75 minutes corresponds to 18° at the equator, since 75 min * 15°/hr = 18.75° ~ 18° allowing a small refraction margin ￼.) Similar sets exist for Isha with slightly different coefficients ￼, reflecting differences in using redness vs. whiteness criteria. These formulas produce a higher offset (thus deeper angle) in summer for Fajr – which might seem counterintuitive until one recalls that at higher latitudes in summer, 75 min might not even get you to true night, hence the need for a larger time to reach darkness.
	•	Seasonal Interpolation: The model then uses piecewise-linear interpolation between these anchor points throughout the year ￼ ￼. Essentially, from winter to spring, the required time/angle decreases, then increases toward summer, then symmetrically decreases toward autumn, and increases back to winter values. This creates a smooth annual curve for each latitude. The output of the function can be interpreted either as a time offset (minutes before sunrise for Fajr, after sunset for Isha) or converted to an equivalent depression angle via astronomical calculations. Moonsighting’s implementation chooses the “most favorable” of the empirical value vs. the 18° value for that day to avoid any anomalies ￼. In practice, this means: for Fajr they use whichever is later (since sometimes their curve-fit might yield a slightly earlier Fajr than 18° – likely spurious, so they default to the later, more conservative time) ￼. For Isha, they take whichever is earlier (to avoid excessively late Isha if their function overshoots on some days) ￼. This clever step filters out outliers and ensures the model never contradicts the physical limit that 18° is the earliest possible Fajr and latest possible Isha in any case ￼.
	•	High-Latitude Adjustment: The empirical formula is considered valid up to about 55° latitude ￼. Above that, even the adjusted function can yield times that are impractical or nonexistent (since as noted, beyond ~54.5° the Sun may not reach even 12° in summer ￼). For the band of ~55–60°, the method falls back to a “Sab’u lail” (1/7 of the night) rule: divide the night period into 7 parts, and set Fajr = end of the last seventh, Isha = end of the first seventh ￼. This effectively caps how short the night can be for prayer timing, based on classical juristic allowances. At even higher latitudes (above ~60–65° where periods of 24h daylight or 24h night occur), the instruction is to approximate times by reference to the nearest lower latitude or a fixed baseline (e.g., using the times of a “balanced” location or of Makkah) ￼ ￼. These fallbacks ensure continuity of the schedule when direct astronomical signs fail. They are consistent with juristic opinions and are implemented in a way that avoids burden (“hardship”) on practitioners ￼ ￼.

This Moonsighting model has been tested against observations and found to match closely. An observer from the UK noted that the calculated Fajr and Isha times from this function were, in practice, very accurate and aligned with what he observed, with any differences falling within the small day-to-day variations of the phenomenon ￼. The model’s success lies in its blending of empirical data and sound constraints: it uses real observational curves, enforces logical boundaries (never earlier than astro dawn or later than needed), and switches to juristic rules only when the natural sign is not observable – thereby preserving Sharia compliance ￼ ￼.

To illustrate the dynamic nature of this model, consider the effective Sun depression angles it produces for Fajr under different conditions (approximate values based on the committee’s function and typical solar declinations):
	•	At 0° (equator): Year-round around 18°. (True dawn consistently when Sun ~18° below horizon ￼, matching astronomical twilight at equator.)
	•	At 30° N (e.g. Houston, Cairo): Ranges roughly 17.8° – 18.6° through the year. In winter, dawn might break around 18.1°; in summer, around 17.9° depression. Essentially ~18° all year (only a few minutes variation in Fajr time) – which is why many mid-latitude countries historically chose 18° and didn’t see much issue.
	•	At 50° N (e.g. London, Calgary): Ranges roughly 12° – 15°. In midwinter, true dawn might correspond to ~14° depression; around equinox ~15°; at midsummer it can be as shallow as ~12° (since the Sun never goes much lower) ￼. For example, on June 21 at 50°N, the Sun’s lowest point is only ~16.5° below horizon; dawn effectively starts when it comes up to ~12° below horizon (well before 18° which is never reached). In contrast, on December 21 at 50°N, the Sun goes far below 18°, and dawn begins later – around 14° on the way up. The model captures this by yielding a much longer night (hence smaller Fajr angle) in summer than in winter for high latitudes.

These examples show how the dynamic model adjusts the angle continuously: at low latitudes it converges to the classical 18°, but at higher latitudes it departs significantly, dropping toward ~12° in extreme cases. The net effect is to produce prayer times that match observable reality. In fact, where implemented, this model eliminates the large discrepancies and “nightlessness” gaps created by static methods ￼. It aligns with the principle of ease and universality in Islamic timings ￼ ￼, while keeping fidelity to actual dawn/dusk observations.

From an integration standpoint, Moonsighting’s function (or a similar latitude/season based formula) can output a precise angle for each day and location. For instance, it might tell us that on a given date Fajr corresponds to 17.2° depression at a city in Spain, but 14.5° at a city in Scotland. A prayer time program can then simply solve for the moment the Sun’s center reaches that altitude. The function can be coded as a small routine or even pre-tabulated for efficiency. Since it’s smooth and slowly varying, it won’t cause sudden jumps in the timetable – changes are gradual over days as expected in nature.

It’s worth noting that other researchers have also attempted dynamic or hybrid models. Some Islamic committees have used a dual criteria: e.g. “18° or 1/7-night, whichever yields a later Fajr (or earlier Isha)” – which is essentially a simplified version of what the Moonsighting method does across the board. The Hizbul Ulama of UK and others have published timetables using a combination of angles (e.g. 12° in summer, 15° in spring/fall, 18° in winter) to approximate observations – again acknowledging no single angle works year-round. The Moonsighting model improves on these by providing a continuous function rather than discrete switches, and by being empirically grounded.

Theoretical/Physical Modeling Approaches

An alternative to a purely empirical fit is to use a physical model of sky luminance to determine the twilight angle dynamically. In theory, one could select a threshold of sky brightness that defines “dawn”, and compute the solar depression needed to reach that brightness given atmospheric conditions. This involves modeling how sunlight scatters through the atmosphere at different angles. Some attempts in literature use measurements of sky brightness (in magnitudes/arcsec² or cd/m²) to pinpoint when the brightness starts rising above the nighttime baseline. For example, as mentioned, one study found the sky brightness at the start of dawn corresponds to about 15° depression for the human eye threshold ￼ ￼. Another noted that dawn becomes visible when the blue component of sky light overtakes the other colors around ~13.5°–14° depression ￼.

In principle, one could use standard atmospheric models (taking into account Rayleigh scattering, ozone absorption, etc.) to predict sky illumination as a function of solar altitude. By solving for when illumination equals a certain value (perhaps comparable to starlight or 0.1% of full moonlight), the corresponding sun angle is found. This astronomical model approach would inherently yield a varying angle with latitude/season, because the path length of sunlight through the atmosphere and the portion of the atmosphere being illuminated change with geometry. However, such a model is complex for real-time use – it would require numerical integration or look-up tables of atmospheric transmission, and critically, it would need inputs like aerosol content or air clarity to be accurate. The twilight brightness at 15° in a crystal-clear desert sky can differ from that in a humid or light-polluted urban sky.

For a public-facing app or general calculation, it is usually impractical to gather detailed atmospheric data for each location (e.g. aerosol optical depth, etc.). Therefore, the empirical approach effectively encodes typical atmospheric behavior in its fitted parameters. It assumes an average clear atmosphere. In most cases, this is sufficient. If a user or institution desired, they could tweak the baseline of the empirical model for their locale (for instance, if observations in a particularly light-polluted city show dawn at 12° instead of 14°, one might adjust the function output a bit). But those would be local calibrations on top of the general model.

In summary, while a theoretical radiative-transfer model of twilight could be constructed, it is far simpler and quite accurate to use the empirically derived function as described. It captures the essential variation (latitude and seasonal effect) and inherently accounts for average atmospheric scattering. For academic completeness, one can mention that the empirical model’s results (e.g. 14–15° at mid-latitudes) agree well with the theoretical expectations of when sky luminance exits the astronomical twilight zone and enters the threshold of human vision ￼.

Integrating Elevation, Temperature, and Pressure

Any precise prayer time computation may also incorporate local environmental factors such as the observer’s elevation above sea level, and the atmospheric pressure/temperature (which affect refraction). These factors do not fundamentally change the required twilight angle (since that is defined by light reaching a certain level), but they can slightly adjust the timing of when a given depression is reached or how we interpret depression angles:
	•	Elevation: A higher observation point means a lower effective horizon. The observer can see further “around” the Earth’s curvature, so the Sun appears higher than it would at sea level (conversely, the geometric depression angle to the Sun is less for the same apparent sky brightness). In practical terms, being at a high elevation will make dawn come earlier and Isha later. For example, at 1000 m elevation, the horizon dips by about 1° extra (the exact formula is $\approx 1.06^\circ \times \sqrt{\text{height in km}}$), so one might detect dawn a few minutes sooner ￼. Calculation-wise, one can add the horizon dip angle to the depression: if the model says dawn at -15°, but you’re on a mountain giving 1° additional depression of view, then you might use -14° for that location. Many sunrise/sunset calculators include this correction (e.g., subtracting a certain number of minutes for elevation). A rule of thumb: ~1 minute earlier per 100 m of elevation for sunrise (and similarly delay sunset). A dynamic prayer time algorithm could incorporate elevation by reducing the required depression angle slightly. In the Moonsighting method, they partially account for this under “downward sloping ground” considerations ￼. In summary, including elevation will fine-tune the result – it’s recommended for a public app to at least allow an elevation input.
	•	Atmospheric Refraction (Pressure/Temperature): Standard calculations assume average pressure (1013 hPa) and temperature (10°C) for refraction near the horizon. At the horizon, refraction bends the Sun’s rays about 34′ (0.566°) upward ￼, effectively allowing us to see the Sun (or twilight) when it’s slightly below the geometric horizon. Most algorithms incorporate this by using a “sun altitude = -0.833°” for sunrise (0.5° Sun diameter + 0.333° refraction) ￼. For twilight at -15° or -18°, the refraction is much smaller (only a few arcminutes) because the light is coming through higher, thinner atmosphere. However, if pressure is unusually low (e.g. at high altitude or a high-pressure weather system), refraction is reduced, and the sky might get dark slightly sooner. Conversely, very cold dense air can increase refraction. To be precise, one could apply the standard refraction formula $R \approx (P/1010)\times(283/(273+T))\times1.02/\tan(a+10.3/(a+5.11))$ (with $a$ in degrees) ￼ for the altitude in question. But for simplicity, many implementations just allow the user to input pressure/temperature to adjust the refraction term. The difference this makes for Fajr/Isha (sun ~15° down) is on the order of 0.1° or less, which corresponds to perhaps 1 minute timing difference – largely negligible for most needs. It’s more relevant for the exact sunrise/sunset time. Indeed, Moonsighting.com notes that actual sunset can be ~3 minutes later than calculated if pressure/humidity are high ￼, due to extended refraction keeping the Sun visible ￼. For Fajr/Isha, such extreme refraction scenarios (thick atmosphere near horizon) are not directly applicable since the Sun is well below horizon.
	•	Temperature/Humidity: These affect refraction (as above) and also the transparency of the air. Very humid or hazy air might block faint light from low in the sky, effectively delaying the visible dawn (needing Sun to come higher). Conversely, very clear air can transmit faint twilight better. These factors are hard to quantify without local observation. If needed, one could introduce a small “fudge factor” in the angle for extremely different conditions. For example, an exceptionally light-polluted city might decide to use a shallower angle (like 1° less) because the faint twilight isn’t visible until later. Such adjustments would be empirical. A sophisticated app could offer a “twilight sensitivity” setting, but this is usually not done. It’s reasonable to assume a standard clear atmosphere for the model, which gives a safe, slightly early Fajr (and late Isha) in places with obscured horizons – this erring on safety is acceptable in religious context.

In implementation, incorporating these factors means: after computing the base angle from the latitude/date model, you apply corrections: e.g. subtract the observer’s horizon dip angle due to elevation, and possibly adjust for non-standard refraction. As an example, suppose the base model gives Fajr at -15.0°. If the observer is at 500 m elevation, horizon dip ~0.5°, so one could use -14.5° for final calculation (meaning Fajr a minute or two earlier). If pressure is, say, 5% below standard (roughly equivalent to being at 500 m elevation as well), that might reduce refraction slightly and one might negligibly tweak another 0.1°. These are minor refinements – the dominant factor is still the geometric model of twilight.

Moonsighting’s published schedules implicitly assume an average horizon (they even add a blanket +3 minutes to Maghrib for safety in case of atmospheric variance ￼). For academic rigor and maximum accuracy, it’s good to mention that our dynamic angle model can indeed integrate such parameters. The underlying astronomical calculations (for converting angle to time) already use those parameters, so it’s straightforward: any public code (like NOAA’s solar calculator) allows input of observer elevation and conditions, ensuring the resulting times are as precise as possible.

Integration into Applications and Wiki

For a public-facing website or app, the dynamic twilight angle model would be implemented as a part of the prayer time calculation algorithm. Typically, calculating prayer times involves computing solar declination and altitude for the given date, and solving for when certain altitudes occur. With a static angle, one would plug in e.g. -18° for Fajr. With the dynamic model, the workflow becomes:
	1.	Input: Date, latitude, longitude (and optionally elevation, pressure, etc.). Also the user’s chosen calculation method – in this case we’ll call it “Dynamic Twilight Angle” method (perhaps labeled as “Moonsighting Global method” or similar in the app settings).
	2.	Compute Sun Declination: (This is standard – needed to compute sunrise etc. The app likely already does this via known equations or an ephemeris library.)
	3.	Determine Twilight Depression Angle: Using the latitude and day-of-year, compute the recommended Sun depression for Fajr and for Isha. This is done via the function or formula described. This function could be hard-coded from the piecewise equations  ￼ ￼. (The code provided by Moonsighting is open-source and could be reused; for instance, an implementation in pseudocode is given in the appendix of their documentation, which we could translate to our app’s language.) The output might be, for example, Fajr_angle = 14.7°, Isha_angle = 14.9° for a particular location/date. These angles can have one decimal or two decimals of precision – the model is continuous so one can get a value like 14.72° if desired. (That level of precision is academically interesting, though in reality a minute of time corresponds to ~0.25° at these depressions, so 0.1° precision is more than enough.)
	4.	Compute Times from Angles: With the target angle now known for that day, the program computes the time at which the Sun’s center reaches that angle below the horizon in the morning (for Fajr) and evening (for Isha). This involves solving the solar altitude equation: $\sin h = \sin\phi\sin\delta + \cos\phi\cos\delta\cos H$ for $h = -\text{(twilight angle)}$. Many prayer time libraries already have a routine for “compute time when Sun is at X°”. We just feed it our dynamic X instead of a constant. Because the angle can vary day to day, it’s important to compute it fresh each day. (For efficiency, one could pre-compute a year’s worth in advance since the pattern repeats annually, barring slight differences in declination for different years.)
	5.	Apply Elevation/Refraction Corrections: If the app allows user elevation, adjust the computed time by a minute or two as appropriate (or modify the angle as discussed before solving). Similarly, ensure the solar position calculation itself accounts for standard refraction (most algorithms do). If a user wants extreme accuracy, they could input local pressure and temperature, and the calculation of the Sun’s altitude will then be corrected accordingly.
	6.	Output: The app then outputs the Fajr and Isha times along with the other prayers. The resulting times will smoothly adjust through the seasons. For example, in a high-latitude city, the app might show Isha getting later from winter into spring, then perhaps stalling or even disappearing in June (where it might note “Twilight does not reach darkness – using 1/7-night method” and give a time around midnight). Then Isha times would start reappearing earlier after summer solstice. All of this would be handled behind the scenes by the dynamic angle logic. The user just sees that their prayer times match observed reality (no more extremely early Fajr that they cannot see any light for, etc.).

For an academic wiki or documentation, one would present the formula and perhaps a graph or table of how the twilight angle varies. For instance, one could include a table like:

Latitude	Fajr Angle (Winter Solstice)	Fajr Angle (Summer Solstice)
0° (Equator)	~18.0°  ￼	~18.0° ￼
30° N (Mid-latitude)	~18.1°	~17.9°
50° N (High-latitude)	~14.1°	~12.0°

Approximate Sun depression angles for Fajr at different latitudes and seasons. (Winter = around Dec/Jan; Summer = June/July. Higher latitudes show significantly smaller angles in summer.)

Such a table gives a quick sense of scale – e.g. at 50°N in summer, Fajr isn’t until the Sun is only 12° below, whereas at 0° it’s still ~18°. These values can be backed up by the observational studies cited (indeed ~12–15° for 50°N matches UK observations, and ~18° at equator is historically used) ￼ ￼.

A figure could also be used, for example plotting the twilight angle vs. month for a given latitude. This would show a gently oscillating curve. If needed, one could overlay observational data points to demonstrate the fit. In a technical report or wiki, including the piecewise formula (perhaps in an appendix or footnote) would be useful for transparency, along with references to its source. For instance, one might include the citation: “Moonsighting Committee’s formula defines Fajr depression in minutes after sunset (or before sunrise) as $f(\phi, n) = A(\phi)+…$ etc” ￼. However, for most readers, a descriptive summary as given above suffices, with citations to the Moonsighting research to instill confidence.

Conclusion

After examining both theoretical considerations and extensive empirical evidence, it is clear that the most accurate method for determining Fajr and Isha prayer times is to use a dynamic twilight angle that varies with location and date, rather than any static approximation. The established model by Moonsighting.com provides a practical, well-tested implementation of this principle, yielding depression angles that closely match observed true dawn and dusk across the globe ￼ ￼. By incorporating this model, a prayer timetable can output precise angles (e.g. 17.2° or 14.5° as needed) for each day, which translate into correct prayer times. This approach preserves the integrity of the Shari’ah-defined signs (dawn light and disappearing twilight) in a way that static methods could not, especially in challenging high-latitude environments ￼ ￼.

Furthermore, this dynamic method can be augmented with local parameters – adjusting for observer elevation and actual atmospheric conditions – to refine the calculations to minute-level accuracy. These adjustments are relatively minor but are a welcome addition for completeness, ensuring the model remains robust under different conditions (for instance, giving slightly earlier Fajr for a mountaintop observatory, as would be expected physically).

In summary, the recommended solution for integration into prayer time applications and academic references is: Adopt a latitude- and season-dependent twilight angle algorithm (such as the Moonsighting empirical function), with high-latitude fallbacks and optional refraction/elevation corrections. This yields a system that is adaptive, precise, and validated by observation – meeting the needs of both end-users (who get reliable prayer times year-round) and scholars (who require that the method be grounded in observable reality and sound astronomy). By implementing this, one can avoid the pitfalls of static rules and ensure that Fajr and Isha truly correspond to the first light of dawn and last light of dusk as witnessed in the sky ￼ ￼.
